# Index Webhook API

Send Index ring recording data to any HTTP endpoint.

## Setup

1. In Index 01 Settings, tap **Webhook**
2. Pick the gesture to configure: **Hold & talk** or **Double click & hold**. Each gesture has its own endpoint, headers and payload mode
3. Enter your webhook URL
4. Add any request headers you need (e.g. an auth header)
5. Choose the body format: **Form data** (multipart, the default) or **JSON**
6. For form data, choose what to send: Recording only, Transcription only, or Both.
   For JSON, write the body you want posted (see [JSON body](#json-body))
7. Optionally tap **Send test event** to verify the endpoint, then **Save**

A gesture only sends once its config is saved with a URL. The switch turns sending off without discarding the URL and headers, and the last 20 runs per gesture are listed under **Recent runs**.

## Request Format

```
POST <your webhook URL>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=<uuid>
<each user-configured header>
X-Audio-Size: <byte count>  (when audio is included)
X-Index-Trigger: single-click-hold | double-click-hold | test-event
X-Index-Test: true  (test events only)
```

## JSON body

Set the body format to **JSON** and the request becomes `Content-Type: application/json` with a
body you write yourself, so the ring can post directly to an API that expects its own shape
instead of a multipart form.

Placeholders are substituted before sending:

| Placeholder | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `{{transcription}}` | Transcription text, empty when there is none |
| `{{recordedAt}}` | Unix timestamp in milliseconds |
| `{{trigger}}` | `single-click-hold`, `double-click-hold`, or `test-event` |
| `{{client}}` | Always `ring` |
| `{{test}}` | `true` for test events, `false` otherwise |

Text is escaped as JSON string content, so a transcription containing quotes or newlines is safe
**inside a quoted placeholder** — wrap text placeholders in quotes yourself. `{{recordedAt}}` and
`{{test}}` are a number and a boolean, so they can be used unquoted. A rendered body that is not
valid JSON is not sent; the run is recorded as `INVALID BODY` instead.

```json
{"content": "{{transcription}}", "createdAt": {{recordedAt}}}
```

JSON carries the **transcription only** — audio needs the multipart body, so the payload mode is
not used in this format.

## Multipart Fields

### `audio` (conditional)

Included when payload mode is **Recording only** or **Both**.

- Content-Type: `audio/mp4`
- Filename: `<recordingId>.m4a`
- Format: AAC-LC encoded in M4A container, mono, 16kHz

### `transcription` (conditional)

Included when payload mode is **Transcription only** or **Both**.

- Plain text transcription of the recording

### `test` (test events only)

Set to `"true"` for payloads sent by **Send test event**, so they cannot be mistaken for a recording. Test events carry no `audio` part and a fixed `transcription`.

### `recordedAt` (always)

Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the recording was captured.

### `client` (always)

Always set to `"ring"`.

## Payload Modes

These apply to the multipart format only.

| Mode               | `audio` | `transcription` | `recordedAt` | `client` |
|--------------------|---------|-----------------|--------------|----------|
| Recording only     | Yes     | No              | Yes          | Yes      |
| Transcription only | No      | Yes             | Yes          | Yes      |
| Both               | Yes     | Yes             | Yes          | Yes      |

## Headers

Headers are fully user-configurable in the webhook settings — add as many name/value pairs as you need. They are sent verbatim on every request, so use them for authentication (e.g. an `Authorization` or `X-Widget-Token` header) or any other metadata your server expects.

`X-Audio-Size` is still added automatically when audio is included (it carries the audio byte count) and cannot be overridden.

`X-Index-Trigger` is added automatically to identify the gesture that started the recording — `single-click-hold`, `double-click-hold`, or `test-event` for a manually sent test. The gesture is persisted with the processing task and preserved when a failed recording is retried. Recordings with no known gesture do not fire a webhook at all. Neither `X-Index-Trigger` nor `X-Index-Test` can be overridden by a user-configured header.

> Migration note: a previously configured single webhook is copied to both recording gestures, and an auth token configured before headers were user-settable is carried over as an `X-Widget-Token` header.

## Authentication

Authentication is whatever your headers say it is. The original integration used an `X-Widget-Token` header; the example below keeps that convention, but any scheme works.

## Example: Receiving with a simple server

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def receive():
    token = request.headers.get('X-Widget-Token')
    if token != 'your-secret-token':
        return 'Unauthorized', 401

    audio = request.files.get('audio')
    transcription = request.form.get('transcription')
    recorded_at = request.form.get('recordedAt')
    trigger = request.headers.get('X-Index-Trigger')

    if audio:
        audio.save(f'/tmp/{audio.filename}')
        print(f'Received audio: {audio.filename}')

    if transcription:
        print(f'Transcription: {transcription}')

    print(f'Recorded at: {recorded_at}')
    print(f'Trigger: {trigger}')
    return 'OK', 200
```

## Notes

- Uploads are async and non-blocking — they don't delay the normal recording pipeline
- Failed uploads are retried on the next recording (no persistent retry queue)
- The recording is always processed normally (transcription + agent) before the webhook fires
- Audio is the same 16kHz resampled version used for transcription
